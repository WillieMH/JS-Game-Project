# INTRODUCTION
The third Nology project is to create a Javascript game.

## WHAT IT IS
My attempt at the project is to create a pub quiz style game using
different categories with 3 questions in each round.

## WORK IN PROGRESS
The items I ran out of time to work on;
  - Proper styling inc. SCSS variables and partials
  - Proper responsiveness
  - A different end game
  - A restart/start new quiz button
  - Iron out the creases in the code
  - Utilise the "scoreboard" more
  ...

## ISSUES
  - When game starts and innerHTML for card is updated, unable to remove
    the button from .startGameButton.  Make this button a clickable div?
  - Can't seem to put sound effect into an object :(
  - Had to refactor the original questionHandler object & all associated funcs
